# E-LearningSystem
My first (1500+ line) project in c++, An E-learning system replicating the one that my University has.
This project is several months old on my PC but I just published it.
The project is sort of a clone of the E-learning platform we use at my university, the system has some basic functionality like:
-Allow students and lecturers to register and login
-Doctor can create courses, assignments, view students' submissions, grade them, etc.
-Student can view courses, register new courses, submit to assignments, check grades, etc.

There are many things that I know need to be improved and some bugs(and may or may not change as this project is a bit old now).
